Gas Leakage monitoring &amp; Alerting system for Industries
Gas leakage leads to various accidents resulting into both financial loss as wellas human injuries. In human's daily life, environment gives the most significant impact to their health issues. The risk of fires, explosion, suffocation, all arebasedon their physical properties such flammability, toxicity etc. The number of deaths due to the explosion of gas cylinders has been increasing in recent years. The reason for such explosion is due to sub-standard cylinders, old valves, worn out regulators and lack of awareness using gas cylinders add to risks. Inspections by oil companies found that many LPG consumers are unaware of safety checks of gas cylinders.In other to minimize or eliminate the hazard of gas leakage there is a need for a system to detect and alert on such incidence leading to the development of this project.The leakage of gases only can be detected by human nearby and if there are no human nearby, it cannot be detected. But sometimes it cannot be detected by human that has a low sense of smell. Thus, this system will help to detect the presence of gas leakage.
